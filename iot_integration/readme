1. Install pip
    Install pip using curl: If pip is not installed on your system, you can install it using the following commands.
    First, download the get-pip.py script using curl:
        curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py

    Run the script to install pip: After downloading the get-pip.py script, run it with Python to install pip:
        python get-pip.py
        Or, if you're using Python 3:

    python3 get-pip.py
    Verify the installation: Once the installation is complete, verify that pip is installed by running:
        pip --version
        This should return the version of pip installed.
